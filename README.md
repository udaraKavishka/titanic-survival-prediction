# Titanic Survival Prediction - Beginner Machine Learning Task

I'm excited to announce the successful completion of a Beginner Machine Learning Task. ðŸš¢

The task involved predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on a historical dataset containing details about the passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and survival status.

## Project Overview

This project follows the fundamental steps of data science, from data collection to model evaluation, in order to build a predictive model to determine whether a passenger would have survived the Titanic disaster.

## Steps Followed

### â—¼ Data Collection
Gathering the relevant data for the project.

### â—¼ Data Preparation
Cleaning and processing the data, including normalization, handling duplicates and errors, addressing potential biases, and identifying missing values.

### â—¼ Data Visualization
Utilizing various graphs and charts to explore the data and identify patterns.

### â—¼ Model Selection
Choosing a suitable algorithm for the task. In this case, a Logistic Regression model was employed.

### â—¼ Data Splitting
Dividing the data into training and testing sets. The training set is used to build the model, and the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.

### â—¼ Model Training
Training the model on the prepared data.

### â—¼ Model Evaluation
Assessing the model's accuracy using various metrics.

## Outcome

Through this process, I built a predictive model that can determine whether a passenger would have survived the Titanic disaster.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn



## Future Improvements

- Explore more advanced models for prediction (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Hyperparameter tuning for better model performance.
- Perform cross-validation for more reliable accuracy metrics.
